## About the Prework:

This prework aims to help you get comfortable with coding dynamic websites before we delve deeper into frontend development in module 2. You don't need to know how to code these projects beforehand; the goal is to familiarize yourself with frontend concepts and tools.

## Your Pathways:

Choose your pathway based on your goals and level of experience:

- **Pathway 1 - Coding Along (Level 1)**:
  - Complete all 15 projects by coding along with the videos.

- **Pathway 2 - Mixed Approach (Level 2)**:
  - Complete all 15 projects.
  - For at least 2 projects, challenge yourself to program without following the video step-by-step, but by referring to the final result provided.

- **Pathway 3 - Advanced (Level 3)**:
  - Complete all 15 projects as in Level 1.
  - Complete an additional 5 projects of your choice from the remaining videos (totaling 20+ projects).

## File Structure:

All projects in this repository follow the same file structure:

- **HTML files**: Contains the markup for the project.
- **CSS files**: Contains the styles for the project.
- **Script.js (in some cases)**: JavaScript code may be embedded in the HTML file or provided in a separate script.js file.
